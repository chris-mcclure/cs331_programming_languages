# Programming Languages
This repository serves as a collection of the homework assigned in <i>CS331 Progamming Languages</i> at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

<ul>

  <li> HW1 is largely based on parse trees and grammar.</li>

  <li> HW2 is comprised of multiple math based functions and coroutines.</li>

  <li> HW3 is a lexer that takes different strings and returns the category of each character in the returned lexeme string.    </li>

  <li> HW4 is a parser that interprets the lexeme string returned by HW3. </li>

  <li> HW5 is comprised of multiple functions using recursion and lists in Haskell. </li> 

  <li> HW6 is an interpreter that combines lexit.lua and parseit.lua from HW3 and HW4 and creates code specific to the <i>Jerboa</i> language.</li>

  <li> HW7 encompasses four different programming languages; Jerboa, <i>Forth</i>, <i>Scheme</i>, and <i>Prolog</i>. The programs consist of one main function each that performs arithmetic on lists and numbers. </li>

  <li> HW8 is a paper written on the characteristic, performance, and feel of the programming language <i>Erlang</i>. </li>

</ul>
